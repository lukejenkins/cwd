# Instructions for Copilot

Write code with clear variable names and include explanatory comments for non-obvious logic. Avoid shorthand syntax and complex patterns.

Provide full implementations rather than partial snippets. Include import statements, required dependencies, and initialization code.

Add defensive coding patterns and clear error handling. Include validation for user inputs and explicit type checking.

Suggest simpler solutions first, then offer more optimized versions with explanations of the trade-offs.

Briefly explain why certain approaches are used and link to relevant documentation or learning resources.

When suggesting fixes for errors, explain the root cause and how the solution addresses it to build understanding. Ask for confirmation before proceeding.

Offer introducing basic test cases that demonstrate how the code works and common edge cases to consider.

Write concise, technical python code with accurate examples

Always prioritize readability and clarity.

Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes

Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication

Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions.

Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.

Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.

For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments.

Use consistent naming conventions and follow language-specific best practices.

Write concise, efficient, and idiomatic code that is also easily understandable.

We will use Python3 and dotenv.

Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
